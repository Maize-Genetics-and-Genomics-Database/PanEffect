# PanEffect
PanEffect is a JavaScript framework to explore variant effects across a pangenome.  The tool has two views that allows a user to (1) explore all possible amino acid substitutions and their variant effects for a reference genome, and (2) view the natural variation and their effects across a pangenome.
